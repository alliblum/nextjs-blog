          You might think the only way to get buy-in on Jobs To Be Done is to
          quit your job/fire your clients and find a team that “gets it”

          people.

        <Text>Here's how I know:</Text>
        <Text>
          A few years ago I ran a JTBD study, identified the job stories, &
          shared the output with the CEO who hired me.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          "I love this! Present it in all hands." I did, and everyone there
          seemed to "love" it, too. Emojis in the Zoom chat, DMs after. The
          works.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          And then... nothing happened. After that project presentation, few
          people consulted the recordings, the transcripts, or the artifacts.
          The research didn't make its way into other decision-making centers
          outside of the ones I was already in.

        <Heading size="lg">
          It's hard enough to get buy-in on doing user research. Or doing Jobs
          To Be Done research. Or researching your ICP.
        </Heading>
        <Heading size="lg">
          {' '}
          It's even harder to get buy-in on applying your findings.
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          I was a product marketer at the time. My charter was to improve
          onboarding and activation metrics and drive adoption of new features.
          My data was telling me that the product team was shipping features no
          one wanted while ignoring Grand Canyon sized growth opportunities. But
          because the JTBD research findings didn’t take hold in the product
          department. After my presentation, I still found myself pushing a
          boulder up a hill pitching product features no one wanted.

          <Text>
            The soul-crushing blow of doing all that work, getting all that
            data, only for nothing to change.

          <Text>At first I grumbled. Ooooooh how I grumbled.</Text>
          <Text>"No one is listening to me."</Text>
          "These ding dongs just don't get it."
        </Text>
        <Text>
          "Man, maybe this research isn't as important as I thought, maybe I got
          bad advice."
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I didn’t know what to do differently, so I ended up leaving the
          company.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I joined a new company and, long story short, the same thing happened.{' '}
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I started to think seriously about the role I was playing in this
          frustrating outcome.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I knew that other people were good at mobilizing VOC around their
          organizations.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I knew that other people were able to ship copy that used raw VOC,
          build onboarding around customer Jobs To Be Done, ship features for a
          single ICP.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I knew that other people were turning their ability to mobilize their
          understanding of a customer into high-paying career paths.
        </Text>

        <Text>So I had to ask myself: what’s more likely?</Text>

        <Text>
          Is it more likely that every person I work with is a doofus who
          doesn’t get it and everyone other teamspeople arework with is
          naturally good at using VOC?
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Or is it more likely that most teams have some people who understand
          qualitative data and other people who don’t understand its
          valuequalitative data?{' '}
        </Text>

        <Text>Is it more likely that everyone around me is a dumb dumb? </Text>

        <Text>
          Or is it more likely that I am not approaching buy-in for customer
          research in a way that gets me the alignment, rigor, and brilliant
          strategic approach that I know my team is capable of.
        </Text>

        <Text>Until one day I couldn’t ignore it:</Text>

        <Text>[gif or something] It’s me… Hi…. I’m the problem it’s me.</Text>
        <Heading size="lg">
          The only common variable in my failed attempts to get buy-in on
          research was me.
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          Well, me and the 50 or so product, UX, and research people trying to
          build a more customer centric culture at their companies.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I realized that everything about my approach (and everyone trying to
          get buy-in) was wrong.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          And then wWhen I finally realized the right way to go about getting
          buy-in, everything changed.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I figured out how to get product and marketing to stop silently
          seething over who had the most “correct” understanding of their ICP.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I figured out how to get “out of touch” execs to understand why we
          should or shouldn’t pursue one strategy or another.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I figured out how to get “hardened engineers” to spend an hour reading
          VOC every day so I’m not the only one pushing back on product features
          no one wants.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          And the first step to making it all happen: breaking down my invisible
          beliefs and faulty understandings of the work I was actually doing.
        </Text>
        <Heading>

          Could your invisible beliefs or faulty understanding of what it means

          I’ve created a free email course to help[some kind of transition here]

          I’ll send you an email a day outlining the invisible beliefs silently
          holding you back (without you even realizing it) that hold you back
          from getting other people to care about and use customer research
          buy-in on incorporating customer-centric strategies at work - plus the
          tactics I use to thwart this belief before it gets in my way.
