          The same phenomenon is true for visionary founders. As believers in
          visionaries, it’s one thing to hear the vision filtered through the
          experience of the visionary. It’s an entirely different thing to
          discover the same forces, problems, and opportunity. To really embrace
          and understand how to act on a vision, team members “have to see it to
          believe it.”{' '}
