          Listening to your team spin their wheels, brainstorm ideas, and add
          more ideas to an ever-growing backlog - and wondering why it’s taking
          so long to ship work that increases your acquisition, activation, and

        </Text>
        <Heading size="lg">An uncomfortable truth: </Heading>
        <Heading size="lg">
          Your team doesn’t see what you see. They don’t know what you know. And
          no matter how many times you explain it, they will rarely embrace your
          vision this way.
        </Heading>{' '}
        <Heading size="lg">Why?</Heading>
        <Text>
          For one thing, you’ve spent years understanding the problem you’re
          solving, there simply isn’t enough time in the day to transmute the
          wholeness of your wisdom into the brain of another person with
          conversation alone.{' '}
        </Text>
        <Text>
          And even if you could share the entirety of what you’re asking people
          to see, your team doesn’t need to know all of your vision, they need
          to know what’s important now, this month, this quarter, this year. In
          fact, sharing too much of your vision at the wrong time or in the
          wrong way can make it harder for your team to know what’s important
          right now.{' '}
        </Text>
        <Text>
          For another, perhaps more important thing, we humans are prone to a
          variety of biases that make it difficult to trust the word of someone
          else over what we ourselves experience. Think of a time when someone
          told you how hot it was outside with sweat dripping down their
          forehead, what did you think? “Wow must be hot.” When you went
          outside, what did you feel? “OMG they were right I’m in hell I need
          lemonade in my veins.”
        </Text>{' '}
        <Text>
          The same phenomenon is true for visionary founders. As believers in
          visionaries, it’s one thing to hear the vision filtered through the
          experience of the visionary. It’s an entirely different thing to
          discover the same forces, problems, and opportunity. To really embrace
          and understand how to act on a vision, team member “have to see it to
          believe it.”{' '}
        </Text>
        <Text>
          And finally, you having a vision, your team believing in that vision,
          and your team knowing what matters now, and being excited to execute
          on that vision does not equate to your team being operationally ready
          to execute on that vision.
        </Text>
        <Heading size="lg">
          Now you can ship faster, juice your metrics, and fully step into your
          role as a visionary leader - all while having even fewer meetings and
          DMs. Here’s how.
