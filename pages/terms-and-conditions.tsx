          Hypothesis Department user, Hypothesis Department reserves the right

          rights or remedies of Hypothesis Department under these Terms of Use,
          Hypothesis Department reserves the right to investigate any situation
          that appears to involve any of the above, and may report such matters
          to, and cooperate with, appropriate law enforcement authorities in
          prosecuting any users who have participated in any such violations.
          You agree to comply with the above conditions, and acknowledge and
          agree that Hypothesis Department has the right, in its sole
          discretion, to terminate your access to the Service or take such other
          action as we see fit if you breach any of the above conditions or any
          of the other terms of these **Terms of Use.** This may include taking
          court action and/or reporting offending users to the relevant
          authorities. 1. Pricing; Charges on Your Account. a. General. Please
          note that the billing policies that are disclosed to you in
          subscribing to the service are deemed part of this Terms of Use.
          Notwithstanding anything herein, you are solely responsible for all
          taxes associated with your use of the Service. b. Billing. Hypothesis
          Department bills you through an online account (your "Billing
          Account") for use of the Service. You agree to pay Hypothesis
          Department all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the
          Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your
          Billing Account, and you authorize Hypothesis Department to charge
          your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the Service.
          You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.
          Hypothesis Department reserves the right to correct any errors or
          mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received
          payment. c. Recurring Billing. Our subscription plans to the Service
          consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge,
          followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By entering
          into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your subscription has an
          initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility
          for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Hypothesis Department
          may submit periodic charges (e.g. monthly) without further
          authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (confirmed in
          writing by Hypothesis Department) that you have terminated this
          authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will
          not affect charges submitted before Hypothesis Department could
          reasonably act. You may change your payment method or cancel your paid
          membership by a provider of your chosen Payment Method (the "Payment
          Method Provider") by emailing us at **alli@HypothesisDepartment.com**.
          For your convenience, we take your payment information so that your
          Hypothesis Department membership will not be interrupted. We
          auto-renew your membership at the level you selected. Your Hypothesis
          Department subscription will be automatically extended for successive
          renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term
          originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription
          rate (if applicable). To cancel, simply email us at Hypothesis
          Department. Please note that you will not be eligible for a prorated
          refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the
          then-current subscription period. d. Current Information Required. YOU
          MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR
          BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR
          BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN
          BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE),
          AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY HYPOTHESIS DEPARTMENT IF YOUR PAYMENT
          METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF
          A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR
          USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE
          MADE BY EMAILING US AT **ALLI@HYPOTHESISDEPARTMENT.COM**. IF YOU FAIL
          TO PROVIDE HYPOTHESIS DEPARTMENT ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU
          AGREE THAT HYPOTHESIS DEPARTMENT MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE
          OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED
          YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE (CONFIRMED BY YOU IN WRITING UPON
          REQUEST BY HYPOTHESIS DEPARTMENT). e. Payment Method. The terms of
          your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be
          determined by agreements between you and the financial institution,
          credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method. f.
          Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use
          of the Service reaffirms that Hypothesis Department is authorized to
          charge your Payment Method. Hypothesis Department may submit those
          charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This
          does not waive Hypothesis Department’s right to seek payment directly
          from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per
          usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the
          Service. 1. No Employment or Agency Relationship. You acknowledge and
          agree that these Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy, do not create
          any employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship
          between you and Hypothesis Department. You Bear Risk of Upload.
          Hypothesis Department uses reasonable security measures in order to
          attempt to protect any content or information that you upload,
          including without limitation any information, photographs or other
          images, or intellectual property (collectively, “Your Data”). However,
          Hypothesis Department cannot guarantee that there will be no
          unauthorized copying or distribution of Your Data nor will Hypothesis
          Department be liable for any copying or usage of Your Data not
          authorized by Hypothesis Department. You hereby release and forever
          waive any claims you may have against Hypothesis Department for any
          such unauthorized copying or usage of Your Data, under any theory of
          liability. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR DATA USED BY
          HYPOTHESIS DEPARTMENT HEREIN ARE PROVIDED AND USED "AS-IS" AND WITH NO
          WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND
          ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO CRACKS,
          DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.
          **Modifications to Service, Termination of Service.** Hypothesis
          Department reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue,
          temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or
          without notice. You agree that Hypothesis Departmentshall not be
          liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension
          or discontinuance of the Service. **Blocking of IP Addresses.** In
          order to protect the integrity of the Services, Hypothesis Department
          reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to block Users
          from certain IP addresses from accessing the Websites and/or Service.
          **Term.** This Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect while
          you use the Websites and/or Service. You may terminate your membership
          at any time by emailing us at **alli@hypothesisdepartment.com**. If
          you resign or cancel your membership to Hypothesis Department, to help
          Hypothesis Department analyze and improve the Service, you may be
          asked to provide a reason for your resignation/cancellation.
          Hypothesis Department may terminate your membership for any reason by
          sending notice to you at the email address you provide in your
          application for membership, or such other email address as you may
          later provide to Hypothesis Department. All decisions regarding the
          termination of accounts shall be made in the sole discretion of
          Hypothesis Department. Hypothesis Department is not required to
          provide you notice prior to terminating your membership. Hypothesis
          Department is not required, and may be prohibited, from disclosing a
          reason for the termination of your account. Even after your membership
          is terminated, this Terms of Use will remain in effect. All terms that
          by their nature may survive termination of this Terms of Use shall be
          deemed to survive such termination. **1. Third Party Content.**
          Hypothesis Department may provide third party content on the Websites
          and/or Service and may provide links to webpages and content of third
          parties (collectively, the “Third-Party Content”) as a service to
          those interested in this information. Hypothesis Department does not
          control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and makes no
          representation or warranties of any kind regarding the Third-Party
          Content, including without limitation regarding its accuracy or
          completeness. Please be aware that Hypothesis Department does not
          create Third-Party Content, nor does Hypothesis Department update or
          monitor it. Hypothesis Department is therefore not responsible for any
          Third-Party Content on the Service. You use such Third-Party Content
          at your own risk. The Service may include links or references to other
          web sites or services solely as a convenience to Hypothesis Department
          users (collectively, the “Reference Sites”). Hypothesis Department
          does not endorse any Reference Sites or the information, materials,
          products, or services contained on or accessible through Reference
          Sites. In addition, your correspondence or business dealings with, or
