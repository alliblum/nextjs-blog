          What does world look like today? launched a tiny product in 2020 and
          had paying customers almost immediately. Four years later, the team
          has discovered that the original product has too small a TAM. While
          one co-founder continues to grow and maintain the original business,,
          another co-founder, and a design lead are leading an R&D initiative to
          refine the strategy, positioning, product features, and marketing
          messaging for a new product. is a visionary founder. She can see the
          world far into the future and has nearly limitless ideas about what we
          could do. To start making progress in the right direction now, she and
          the team need a mechanism to make a long-term vision concrete and
          actionable in the near term, they need a way to say, “Let’s start
          here.” The company is transitioning from a “Mother” model of being
          very service-oriented to a “Mechanic” model of teaching customers
          exactly what they need, even if they aren’t sure if they need it yet.
          Revenue is in the millions for an already existing product. Revenue
          potential is unknown for the new product. The team is facing a dilemma
          many companies led by visionary founders face: “Of all the things we
          could do next, what should we do - and how do we fail fast and get as
          much feedback as we can as soon as we can?” How will we accelerate
          this change and innovation work? Our work together is about building a
          foundation for long-term scaleable growth. The first step in our work
          is to get the insights and build the alignment around our
          JTBD-informed product, positioning, and marketing strategy. To do
          that, we will: Build a coalition around setting a solid foundation for
          new product Pair with Jess and team to understand what the feedback &
          VOC you have already collected is showing, codify what we can, and
          pinpoint "known unknowns" to investigate in our study Investigate a
          switch moment adjacent to the “anti-help desk” vision Conduct
          interviews, analyze results, form JTBD artifacts, and get everyone
          bought in and excited about findings Begin translating findings into
          positioning, messaging, product strategy, hypotheses and experiments
          for long-term growth
