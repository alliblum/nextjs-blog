          They always say "talk to your customers" but what does that really
          mean?{' '}

        <Text>
          Maybe you've talked with customers yourself and walked away with no
          more insight than before you had the conversation. Or worse: maybe you
          applied findings from a user interview only to find they backfired.
        </Text>
        <Text>What went wrong?</Text>
        <Text>
          I blame user researchers like me for dishing out overly simplified and
          hard-to-follow advice. We distilled an entire field and all its nuance
          into a short 4-word command to "talk to your customers" that offers as
          much practical advice about how to actually follow that command as
          other shorthand commands like "learn to code" or "charge more" or
          "fold in the cheese."
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Which leads many well-intentioned founders to ignore user research
          altogether and build off what your gut says, what investors demand, or
          what you hear about piecemeal from randos online. You end up with a
          product that grows somewhat, somehow, but never enough.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Or worse - this advice leads you to run interviews that actively lead
          you astray. Without knowing what "good" looks like, you risk asking
          questions that give you a faulty understanding of what your best
          prospects and customers want. You end up building your entire str

          A project just small enough that you don't have to worry about fitting
          a giant project into an already busy project roadmap, about getting an
          entire team onboard with a new strategy, or about making a large
          investment in a full-size research project that you might not be ready
          for. Not yet, anyway.

          After we meet to talk about the questions stopping your business from
          growing, I'll prep, run, and share an interview with a customer. This
